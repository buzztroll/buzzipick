# Buzz iPick

This distribution includes programs for pulling pictures out of the Apple Photos' database and displaying them in
a web browsers.  My hope is to write this in a few (go, java, rust... C?!) of languages but I will likely just make
it in python quickly for my own use and stop pretending that anyone cares about the code I write.

## PyPicker

Under the directory `pypicker` is a python program that uses flask to pull pictures out of the Apple Photos' sqlite 
database and randomly selects one picture for display.
